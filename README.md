### Hi there 👋

I currently a Technical Project Manager and a Full Stack React Engineer in training, with 3+ years of combined professional experience working as a Technology Manager, Production Support Engineer, and Application Support at companies such as JPMorgan Chase and Digitas Health. I have proven working knowledge of programmatic thinking to build user interfaces and create interactive web experiences using Full Stack JavaScript. I can work in an Agile or Waterfall team to improve workflow and project delivery. Because I have gained exposure to project management, quality assurance, accessibility testing, deployments, cloud, and the SRE tool sets it makes me adaptable in any engineering space. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for ensuring client satisfaction, I am eager to apply my expertise to a software engineering role where I can contribute to building innovative and user-friendly applications.
